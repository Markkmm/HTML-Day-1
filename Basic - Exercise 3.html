                Seven billion souls that move around the sun
                Rolling faster, faster, not a chance to slow down
                Slow down
                Men who made machines that want what they decide
                Parents tryna tell the children please slow down
                Slow down

                Every day gets hotter than the one before
                Running out of water, it's about to go down
                Go down
                Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
                Birds were made for singing, wakin' up to no sound
                No sound
            </P>
